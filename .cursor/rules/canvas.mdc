# Canvas Diagram Guidelines

## Purpose
Canvas diagrams help visualize complex relationships between components, workflows, and architectural decisions.

## Structure
- Use clear titles and subtitles
- Group related elements with color coding
- Include legends for complex diagrams
- Number sequence steps where applicable

## Color Coding
- Green: Primary flows and successful paths
- Blue: Information and neutral elements
- Yellow: Decision points and warnings
- Red: Errors and problem areas

## Connections
- Use arrows to show direction of flow
- Label connections where necessary
- Use dotted lines for optional paths
- Use solid lines for required paths

## Best Practices
- Keep diagrams focused on a single concept
- Update diagrams as architecture evolves
- Include relevant notes and context
- Reference related documentation
