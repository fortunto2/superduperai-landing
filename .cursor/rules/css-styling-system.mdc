# SuperDuperAI CSS & Styling System

This project uses a comprehensive CSS styling system with custom utility classes and Tailwind CSS.

## Theme Configuration
- Dark theme with green accents is defined in globals.css
- Theme is forced via the `dark` class on the HTML element in layout.tsx
- Tailwind configuration in tailwind.config.js extends theme with CSS variables

## Custom Utility Classes

The project defines several utility classes for consistent styling:

### Interactive Elements
- `.btn-accent` - Green accent buttons with glow effects
- `.input-enhanced` - Form inputs with accent-colored focus states

### Containers & Cards
- `.card-enhanced` - Cards with hover effects, shadows, and gradient borders
- `.glassmorphism` - Elements with glass-like transparency and blur effects
- `.gradient-border` - Adds a subtle gradient border to elements

### Text & Typography
- `.neon-text` - Text with subtle glow effects for emphasis

### Background Effects
- `.gradient-section` - Sections with gradient backgrounds
- `.animated-bg` - Sections with subtle animated background effects
