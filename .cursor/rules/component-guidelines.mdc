# SuperDuperAI Component Guidelines

This document outlines best practices for working with components in the SuperDuperAI landing page.

## Component Structure
Each component follows a consistent pattern:
- Import section with React, UI components, and helpers
- Client-side directive (`"use client"`) where needed for interactivity
- Animation constants (when using Framer Motion)
- Component function with JSX return
- Internal data structures for content

## Animation System
- Uses Framer Motion for animations - see examples in hero.tsx
- Common patterns include:
  - Entrance animations with opacity and Y-axis movement
  - Staggered children animations for lists and grids
  - Hover animations on interactive elements
  - Viewport-triggered animations using `whileInView`

## Styling Conventions
- Component structure uses semantic HTML (section, header, div, etc.)
- Tailwind classes for layout and basic styling
- Custom utility classes from globals.css for effects
- BEM-like naming for component-specific styles

## Content Guidelines
- All user-facing text must be in English
- Use consistent terminology throughout components
- Maintain hierarchy with clear headings and concise descriptions
- Follow the established visual language with green accents for important elements
