# SEO Best Practices

This rule outlines essential SEO practices for React components and links to ensure optimal search engine visibility and ranking.

## Link Best Practices

1. **Always add title attributes** to all links, making them descriptive and relevant to the linked content:
   ```jsx
   <Link href="/about" title="About Our Company">About</Link>
   ```

2. **Use rel="nofollow"** for external links to prevent passing SEO weight:
   ```jsx
   <a href="https://external-site.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">External Link</a>
   ```

3. **Include descriptive text** in links rather than generic phrases like "click here" or "read more":
   ```jsx
   // Good: <Link href="/pricing">View Our Pricing Plans</Link>
   // Bad: <Link href="/pricing">Click Here</Link>
   ```

4. **Ensure consistent navigation** structure across the site for better crawler understanding.

## Image Best Practices

5. **Always include alt text** for all images, describing the image content:
   ```jsx
   <Image src="/product.jpg" alt="Product XYZ with feature highlights" />
   ```

6. **Add title attributes** to images where appropriate:
   ```jsx
   <Image 
     src="/screenshot.png" 
     alt="Dashboard screenshot showing user analytics" 
     title="SuperDuperAI Analytics Dashboard"
   />
   ```

7. **Optimize image file sizes** and use next-gen formats like WebP or AVIF where possible.

## Structure Best Practices

8. **Use semantic HTML elements** correctly (h1, h2, nav, main, section, etc.), with only one h1 per page.

9. **Implement structured data** (Schema.org) where applicable to enhance rich snippets.

10. **Ensure meta tags** are properly implemented in all page components:
    ```jsx
    export const metadata = {
      title: 'Page Title - Site Name',
      description: 'Clear, compelling description under 160 characters',
      openGraph: {
        // OpenGraph properties
      }
    };
    ```

## Performance Considerations

11. **Lazy load images** and other heavy content that appears below the fold.

12. **Avoid excessive JavaScript** that might impact page load time and Core Web Vitals.

Follow these practices consistently across all components to maintain high SEO standards.
