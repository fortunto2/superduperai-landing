# Kling 2.1

Kling 2.1 is Kuaishou's fast text‑to‑video system. It can create clips up to
around two minutes long and offers several quality tiers from quick previews to
1080p "Master" renders. Motion looks smooth and camera moves are handled well,
making it useful for short promos or pre‑visualising scenes. Kling outputs only
visuals, so audio must be added separately and high‑quality renders take longer
to complete.

## Best Use Cases

- Short social media videos or meme clips
- Pre‑visualising cinematic shots and camera moves
- Animating still images with subtle motion

## Prompting Tips

- Describe the key action and camera movement
- Use cinematic terms like close‑up or wide angle
- Keep prompts focused on a single scene or action

## Strengths

- Smooth, realistic motion and consistent subjects
- Multiple quality modes for quick drafts or high‑end output
- Excels at image‑to‑video conversion
- Can maintain coherence for clips up to a couple of minutes

## Limitations

- No audio generation
- Struggles with fine text or very complex scenes
- Longer renders cost more time and compute
- Official access is limited to certain platforms
