## Professional Prompting Structure

Creating effective VEO3 prompts requires understanding the optimal structure. Follow this 8-point framework for best results:

### 1. Scene Description
Overall description of what's happening, who's involved, and the general atmosphere

### 2. Visual Style
Overall look and feel - cinematic, realistic, animated, stylized, or surreal

### 3. Camera Movement
How camera moves - slow pan, static shot, tracking shot, aerial zoom

### 4. Main Subject
Primary person, character, or object that should be the focus

### 5. Background Setting
Specific location or environment where scene takes place

### 6. Lighting/Mood
Type of lighting and emotional tone you want

### 7. Audio Cue
Specific sound or music during the scene

### 8. Color Palette
Dominant colors or tones - bold, pastel, muted, monochrome

## Best Practices for VEO3 Prompts

### Use Natural Language
Write as you would speak - VEO3 understands conversational descriptions better than technical jargon.

### Be Descriptive and Detailed
More information leads to better output. Include specific details about characters, settings, and actions.

### Avoid Quotes for Dialogue
Instead of using quotes, describe speech naturally: "Character says hello" rather than "Character says 'hello'"

### Consider Cultural Context
Language influences visual elements - mentioning specific languages affects clothing, architecture, and cultural details.

### Optimize Prompt Length
Longer prompts generally produce better results, but focus on relevant details that enhance your vision.

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Character Scenes
VEO3 excels at handling complex interactions between multiple characters, maintaining consistency in appearance and behavior throughout the video.

### Professional Camera Controls
Define specific shot types, camera movements, and cinematic techniques for film-quality results.

### Audio-Visual Synchronization
Generate videos with synchronized dialogue, sound effects, and ambient audio that matches the visual content.

### Style Customization
Control lighting conditions, color grading, and visual aesthetics to achieve your desired look.

## Common Use Cases

- **Content Creation**: Social media videos, marketing content, and promotional materials
- **Prototyping**: Visualize concepts before expensive live-action production
- **Education**: Create engaging educational content and tutorials
- **Entertainment**: Generate short films, music videos, and creative projects
- **Business**: Product demonstrations, training videos, and corporate communications

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic prompts and gradually add complexity
2. **Iterate and Refine**: Use generated videos as references to improve subsequent prompts
3. **Study Examples**: Analyze successful VEO3 videos to understand effective prompting patterns
