# Exploring the Powerful AI Models Behind SuperDuperAI

SuperDuperAI integrates six state-of-the-art models for generating images and
video. This overview summarizes their key features, best use cases, prompt tips
and limitations.

## Flux Kontext
Flux Kontext is an in-context editor that accepts an image and a short text
instruction. It is perfect for tweaking photos or keeping a character consistent
across scenes. Edits can be chained, though quality may drop after many steps.

## Google Imagen 4
Imagen 4 produces highly detailed pictures up to 2K resolution with readable
text. Detailed prompts about style and lighting give the best results. The
preview has strict content filters and a 2048Ã—2048 limit.

## OpenAI GPT-Image-1
GPT-Image-1 builds on GPT-4 and supports conversational refinement. Each request
creates a new image, with resolution up to 4K. It cannot edit an uploaded photo
directly, but you can iterate until you achieve the desired look.

## Kling 2.1
Kling 2.1 is a fast text-to-video system that can also animate still images. It
offers quality levels from quick draft to cinema-grade 1080p. Clips are visual
only, so you need to add audio separately.

## Sora
Sora is OpenAI's experimental text-to-video model. Public versions generate short
vertical clips and may take a few minutes to render. Results can be quite
imaginative but there is no audio or long-duration option yet.

## VEO2 Image2Video
VEO2 converts a single image into a short HD video with physics-aware motion. It
preserves the original look while animating elements like clouds or water. Output
length is around eight seconds.

### Choosing the Right Model
Use Imagen 4 or GPT-Image-1 for detailed still images, and Flux Kontext when you
need to edit an existing photo. For video, Kling 2.1 and VEO2 cover most use
cases, while Sora is great for quick experimental clips. Combining these models
lets you generate, modify and animate media directly in SuperDuperAI.
