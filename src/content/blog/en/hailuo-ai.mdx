## Prompting Tips for Best Results

### Keep It Concise
With only 6 seconds available, focus on key elements:
> **Good**: "A knight in armor swings a sword as lightning flashes behind him"
> **Too Complex**: "A knight then mounts a horse and gallops into sunset"

### Use Chinese for Nuance (if possible)
Hailuo is optimized for Chinese language prompts for more accurate results:
- Try translating English prompts to Chinese
- Cultural and historical references work better in Chinese
- More detailed interpretation of subtle descriptions

### Leverage Director Mode
Act like a movie director in your prompts:
> "Camera zooms in slowly on the face, then cuts to wide shot of landscape"

### Iterate for Clarity
Since Hailuo is quite literal:
- Avoid vague descriptions like "a cool scene with an animal"
- Be specific: "polar bear walking under aurora borealis in cool blue tones"
- Use each generation as feedback to refine next prompt

## Strengths

- Completely free with no registration barriers
- Lightning-fast generation (under 30 seconds ideal, 1-2 minutes typical)
- Strict prompt adherence for reliable results
- Director mode for advanced cinematography
- Perfect for social media content creation
- Multi-language support with Chinese optimization

## Limitations

- Limited to 6-second duration per clip
