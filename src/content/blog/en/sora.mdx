# Sora Text2Video

Sora is OpenAI's experimental text‑to‑video model. Public access currently
produces very short vertical clips and rendering may take a few minutes. The
system excels at imaginative, sometimes surreal visuals but does not include
audio. Describe the key action and overall style in a sentence or two for best
results.

## Best Use Cases

- Quick social media snippets or reaction clips
- Visualizing an idea or concept in a few seconds
- Generating playful GIF‑like videos through chat interfaces

## Prompting Tips

- Clearly describe the action and overall style
- Mention if you want a specific art style or medium
- Keep prompts concise to suit the short clip length

## Strengths

- Understands detailed prompts thanks to OpenAI's language models
- Capable of creative, surreal imagery
- Integrates with Bing and other OpenAI tools
- Strong content moderation for safe outputs

## Limitations

- Current clips are only a few seconds long
- Rendering may be slow when servers are busy
- No audio and mostly vertical format
- Access is limited to small trials and selected partners
