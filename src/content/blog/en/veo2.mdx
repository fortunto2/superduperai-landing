# VEO2 Image2Video

VEO2 converts a still image into a short HD video while preserving the original
look. Elements such as water or clouds animate realistically, making it perfect
for turning product photos or artworks into eye‑catching loops. Video length is
limited to about eight seconds and the scene cannot change drastically from the
source image.

## Best Use Cases

- Animating photographs or product shots
- Creating cinemagraphs and looping social posts
- Prototyping scenes by animating concept art

## Prompting Tips

- Focus on describing how the existing image should move
- Use terms like "slowly", "gently" or "rotate" to control motion
- Keep changes plausible relative to the original photo

## Strengths

- Preserves the style and subjects of the source image
- Physically realistic animation with smooth motion
- Outputs crisp HD video up to about eight seconds
- Accepts both text instructions and an image

## Limitations

- Cannot drastically change the composition or add new objects
- Requires a reasonably high‑quality input image
- Rendering takes longer than still images
- Newer Veo versions offer longer clips and audio
