# OpenAI GPT-Image-1

GPT‑Image‑1 brings OpenAI's conversational approach to image generation. You can
describe a scene, review the output and ask for adjustments in a dialogue loop.
Images render at resolutions up to 4096×4096 pixels, suitable even for print.
The model cannot directly edit an uploaded picture, but you can request new
variations until you achieve the desired result.

## Best Use Cases
- Brainstorming or iterating on visual ideas through chat
- Creating high‑detail artwork suitable for print
- Integrating image generation inside creative apps

## Prompting Tips
- Mention art style or genre to guide the look
- Keep prompts focused but allow some creative freedom
- Use a conversational loop to refine the result step by step

## Strengths
- Up to 4K resolution with strong consistency
- Works well in an iterative, conversational workflow
- Excellent understanding of complex descriptions
- Easy to integrate via the OpenAI ecosystem

## Limitations
- Cannot edit an uploaded image directly
- Each request is independent with no persistent memory
- Limited fine‑grained control over parameters
- High resolutions are slower and may cost more
