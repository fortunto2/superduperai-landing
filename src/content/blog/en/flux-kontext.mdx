# Flux Kontext

Flux Kontext is an inâ€‘context image generator and editor. Provide a reference
image together with a short instruction, and the model will modify only the
requested parts while keeping key elements intact. It is ideal for refining
photographs, applying consistent changes across a series and preserving
characters or products. Edits can be chained interactively, though after many
steps some artifacts may appear. Flux Kontext works best for quick corrections
or creating multiple variants without manual photo editing tools.

## Best Use Cases

- Refining photos or renders without manual retouching
- Applying the same change across multiple images
- Iteratively building a visual story while keeping characters consistent

## Prompting Tips

- Use short instructions focused on the element you want to change
- Chain prompts to gradually evolve the image
- Refer directly to objects in the input image when describing edits

## Strengths

- Contextual editing that leaves other areas untouched
- Maintains character and style across edits
- Fast responses enable quick experimentation
- Strong adherence to the provided prompt

## Limitations

- Too many sequential edits can introduce artifacts
- May occasionally skip a specific instruction
- Limited world knowledge for obscure requests
- Accessible mainly through the BFL API or partner services
