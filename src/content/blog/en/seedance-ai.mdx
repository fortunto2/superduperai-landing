## Prompting Tips for Best Results

### Be Descriptive and Specific
Seedance excels at understanding detailed prompts. Instead of "a person moving outdoors", try:
> "A young woman in a red dress dances gracefully through a sunlit forest clearing, leaves swirling around her"

### Leverage Multi-Shot Capabilities
Use connective words to describe scene transitions:
> "A robot walks through a dense forest, then emerges onto a busy city street with neon signs"

### Specify Visual Style
Include artistic direction for consistent aesthetics:
> "Cinematic scene with dramatic lighting in retro 8-bit game style"

### Include Camera Directions
Guide the perspective and movement:
> "Close-up shot that slowly pans around the subject, handheld camera style"

## Strengths

- Exceptional prompt following and detail interpretation
- Professional-grade visual quality and motion
- Multi-shot storytelling capabilities
- Supports diverse artistic styles from photorealistic to fantastical
- Smooth temporal consistency without artifacts

## Limitations

- Credit-based subscription model (0.18 USD for 5-second 720p clip)
- Limited to 5-10 second duration per generation
- Cloud processing required - no local generation
- Pro version needed for full 1080p quality

## Best Use Cases

- Short-form social media content creation
- Cinematic concept prototyping

Seedance AI brings professional video generation capabilities to creators without requiring technical expertise, making it ideal for anyone needing high-quality short-form video content.
