## Key Features

Midjourney V1 takes a unique approach by focusing on image-to-video animation rather than text-to-video generation, leveraging the platform's strength in visual creation.

### Image-to-Video Animation
- Start with any Midjourney-generated image or uploaded artwork
- Animate static images into 5-second video clips
- Maintains original image quality and artistic style
- Four video variations generated per animation request

### Automatic vs Manual Modes
- **Automatic Mode**: AI creates motion prompts automatically for one-click animation
- **Manual Mode**: Write custom motion descriptions for precise control
- **Flexible Control**: Switch between modes to find optimal results

### Motion Intensity Settings
- **Low Motion**: Subtle, gentle movement preserving image clarity
- **High Motion**: Dynamic movement with camera and subject animation
- **Balanced Options**: Choose intensity based on content type

### Video Extensions
- Initial generation produces ~5-second clips
- Extend videos up to 4 times in ~4-second increments
- Create continuous videos up to 20-21 seconds total
- Seamless transitions between extended segments

## Motion Prompting Techniques

### Describe Movement, Not Appearance
Focus on how elements change over time rather than static descriptions:
> **Good**: "The person turns around and waves as camera pulls back slowly"
> **Avoid**: "A beautiful person in detailed clothing"

### Use Cinematic Language
Leverage filmmaking terminology for professional results:
- "Close-up shot", "time-lapse", "dolly zoom"
- "Camera pans left while subject looks up"
- "Slow motion with dramatic lighting"

### One Action at a Time
Keep motion prompts simple for V1's capabilities:
> **Simple**: "Dragon spreads wings and camera shakes as it roars"
> **Complex**: "Dragon flies through forest, lands on mountain, then breathes fire"

### Leverage Automatic Mode for Inspiration
- Try automatic mode first to see AI's interpretation
- Use results as baseline for manual refinements
- Combine automatic ideas with custom directions

## Integration and Pricing

    <summary className="p-4 cursor-pointer font-semibold hover:bg-gray-50 dark:hover:bg-gray-800">
      🎬 How do I create a video with Midjourney's V1 model?
    </summary>
    <div className="p-4 border-t">
      <p>To make a video in Midjourney, first generate an image using the standard /imagine command or upload your own image. Then use the /animate command or Animate button to create a 5-second video clip from that image. You can choose automatic motion generation or write custom motion prompts to control how the image moves.</p>

      💰 Do I need a special subscription for Midjourney video?
    </summary>
    <div className="p-4 border-t">
      <p>No separate payment is needed - any Midjourney subscriber can access video features, including Basic plan ($10/month) users. However, video generation uses about 8x the credits of image generation. Pro and Mega plan subscribers can use relax mode for videos (slower but unlimited generations).</p>

      ⏱️ How long can videos be and can I make them longer?
    </summary>
    <div className="p-4 border-t">
      <p>Initial videos are about 5 seconds long with four variations provided. You can extend videos up to 4 times in roughly 4-second increments, creating continuous videos up to 20-21 seconds total. Each extension takes the last frame and continues the motion from there.</p>

      🎭 What's the difference between Automatic and Manual animation modes?
    </summary>
    <div className="p-4 border-t">
      <p>Automatic mode lets Midjourney create a motion prompt for you based on the image - it's one-click and great for quick results. Manual mode allows you to write specific motion descriptions like "the subject turns left and camera zooms in slowly" for precise creative control. Many users start with automatic to see possibilities, then switch to manual for refinement.</p>

    <summary className="p-4 cursor-pointer font-semibold hover:bg-gray-50 dark:hover:bg-gray-800">
      🔊 Do Midjourney videos have sound and how complex can scenes be?
    </summary>
    <div className="p-4 border-t">
      <p>No, videos are silent MP4 files - you'll need to add audio separately using video editing tools. The V1 model works best with relatively simple motions and single-scene shots. Complex sequences with multiple characters or rapid scene changes may struggle, so consider breaking complex ideas into separate clips that can be edited together.</p>
