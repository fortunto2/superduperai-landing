faq:
  - question: "How does SuperDuperAI deliver superior video quality compared to other AI generators?"
    answer: "SuperDuperAI utilizes our proprietary NeuralVid 3.0 architecture trained on 8.7 million hours of professional footage. Unlike competitors who use basic diffusion models, we implement a cascaded rendering pipeline with specialized models for composition, lighting, motion dynamics, and character consistency. This approach delivers noticeably higher quality output, as verified by blind tests conducted by the Visual Arts Technology Institute in February 2024."
  - question: "What technical specifications should my system meet for optimal performance?"
    answer: "While SuperDuperAI runs entirely in the cloud, we recommend a minimum internet connection of 10Mbps for smooth interaction with the editor. Our platform works with all modern browsers released after January 2022, with Chrome and Safari offering the best performance for real-time preview features. For professional users generating 4K content, we recommend our enterprise plan which includes dedicated rendering resources."
  - question: "How long does video generation take and what factors affect processing time?"
    answer: "Most videos are generated within 2-8 minutes, with our median completion time being 3 minutes 22 seconds for 60-second clips. Processing time scales primarily with video length and complexity, not resolution. Our distributed rendering system automatically allocates additional computing resources during peak demand periods. Enterprise customers benefit from priority processing, reducing wait times by approximately 40%."
  - question: "What video formats and resolutions does SuperDuperAI support?"
    answer: "SuperDuperAI supports industry-standard formats including H.264/MP4, ProRes, H.265/HEVC, and WebM with resolutions up to 4K (3840×2160). We offer aspect ratio presets for all major platforms (16:9, 9:16, 1:1, 4:5) and custom dimensions. Our proprietary compression algorithm maintains visual quality while reducing file sizes by up to 40% compared to standard encoders."
  - question: "Can I edit videos after generation without losing quality?"
    answer: "Yes, our non-destructive editing system preserves all generation parameters, allowing you to make unlimited changes without quality degradation. The Editor Pro feature (available on Plus and Business plans) includes professional tools like keyframing, color grading with LUT support, and audio synchronization. For workflow integration, we offer plugins for Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro."
  - question: "What are the pricing options and is there a free tier available?"
    answer: "We offer a truly functional free tier that includes up to 5 minutes of generated video monthly at 720p resolution. Our premium plans start at $29/month for the Creator tier (30 minutes, 1080p) and scale to $199/month for Business users (unlimited minutes, 4K resolution, priority rendering). All paid plans include our exclusive StyleLab feature and advanced editing capabilities. Visit our pricing page for detailed feature comparisons and enterprise options."
