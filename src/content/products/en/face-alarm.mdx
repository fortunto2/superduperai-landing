# FaceAlarm

Smart alarm clock that uses face detection to make sure you're actually awake. No more hitting snooze with your eyes closed.

## How It Works

1. **Set your alarm** — just like any alarm clock
2. **Alarm goes off** — sound plays at your chosen time
3. **Show your face** — the alarm stops only when it detects your face with eyes open
4. **You're awake** — no more accidentally falling back asleep

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Uses on-device AI to verify you're actually awake
- **No Snooze Cheating**: Can't dismiss the alarm without showing your face
- **Privacy First**: All face detection runs locally on your device — no data leaves your phone
- **Customizable Alarms**: Multiple alarm sounds, volume ramping, and vibration patterns
- **Sleep Statistics**: Track your wake-up patterns over time

## Why FaceAlarm?

We've all been there — the alarm goes off, you hit snooze half-asleep, and wake up 45 minutes late. FaceAlarm solves this by requiring you to physically face your phone with your eyes open. Simple, effective, and a little bit annoying — exactly what a good alarm should be.
