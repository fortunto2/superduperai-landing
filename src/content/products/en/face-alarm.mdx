# FaceAlarm

Wake up, take a selfie, see your transformation. AI-powered alarm that won't turn off until you capture your daily face photo — the perfect companion for face yoga, gua sha, and skincare routines.

## How It Works

1. **Set your alarm** — choose your time and days of the week
2. **Alarm goes off** — it won't turn off until you take a selfie
3. **AI aligns your face** — smart oval guides and crosshair lines ensure consistent positioning every time
4. **Track your progress** — compare any two photos side by side with precise eye-level alignment

## Features

- **Daily Selfie Alarm**: Alarm won't dismiss until you take your photo — no more skipped days
- **AI Face Alignment**: Smart oval guides and crosshair lines for perfectly consistent selfies
- **Photo Guidance**: Tips for lighting, background, hair, expression, and camera angle
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Select any two photos and compare with precise alignment
- **Progress Gallery**: Browse your daily photos and watch your face transformation over time
- **Privacy First**: Photos never leave your phone, AI works locally, no sign-up required
- **Works Offline**: Full functionality without internet connection

## Who Is It For?

- **Face yoga practitioners** — track results of facial exercises over weeks and months
- **Gua sha & face massage** — see the real effect of your daily routine
- **Skincare enthusiasts** — document how your skin changes with new products or treatments
- **Anyone curious** — just want to see how your face changes over time? FaceAlarm makes it effortless

## Why FaceAlarm?

Consistency is the key to seeing results. Most people start tracking their face yoga or skincare progress but forget after a few days. FaceAlarm solves this with a simple trick: your alarm won't stop until you take a selfie. No exceptions, no excuses — just daily progress captured automatically.
