## About the Jaw Harp

The jaw harp (known as kubyz in Bashkir, vargan in Russian, komus in Turkic languages, dan moi in Vietnamese) is one of the oldest musical instruments in the world. Used across cultures from Siberia to Southeast Asia, it produces distinctive overtone-rich sounds through vibrations of a metal or bamboo reed.

The instrument has been central to the musical traditions of Bashkortostan and other Turkic peoples for centuries. Jaw Harp Synth brings this heritage into the digital age while respecting the authenticity of the sound.
