# Jaw Harp Synth — Privacy Policy

**Last updated: July 1, 2025**

SuperDuperAi Corp. ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Jaw Harp Synth mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our App.

## Our Approach

Jaw Harp Synth is designed with privacy in mind. **The App does not require registration and does not collect or store personal data.**

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- No account or registration required
- No personal information (name, email, phone)
- No location data
- No contacts or address book access
- No browsing or search history
- No user-generated content is uploaded to our servers

## Information Automatically Collected

The App may collect minimal anonymous technical data solely for crash reporting and stability improvements:

- **Crash Data**: Anonymous crash logs to help us fix bugs and improve stability. This data contains no personally identifiable information.
- **Basic Device Info**: Device type and OS version, used only in the context of crash reports.

All sound synthesis and audio processing happens entirely on your device. No audio data is transmitted to external servers.

## Data Storage

All your recordings and settings are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data.

## Third-Party Services

- **Apple App Store**: For app distribution. Subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect any personal information and is safe for users of all ages.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. Your locally stored recordings can be managed directly through the App or your device's file system.

## Changes to This Policy
