# Jaw Harp Synth — Privacy Policy

**Last updated: July 1, 2025**

Rustam Salavatov, an independent developer ("I", "me", or "my"), develops and publishes the Jaw Harp Synth mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use the App.

## Our Approach

Jaw Harp Synth is designed with privacy in mind. **The App does not require registration and does not collect or store personal data.**

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- No account or registration required
- No personal information (name, email, phone)
- No location data
- No contacts or address book access
- No browsing or search history
- No user-generated content is uploaded to any servers

## Information Automatically Collected

The App may collect minimal anonymous technical data solely for crash reporting and stability improvements:

- **Crash Data**: Anonymous crash logs to help fix bugs and improve stability. This data contains no personally identifiable information.
- **Basic Device Info**: Device type and OS version, used only in the context of crash reports.

All sound synthesis and audio processing happens entirely on your device. No audio data is transmitted to external servers.

## Data Storage

All your recordings and settings are stored locally on your device. The developer does not have access to this data.

## Third-Party Services

- **Apple App Store**: For app distribution. Subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect any personal information and is safe for users of all ages.

## Your Rights

Since no personal data is collected, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. Your locally stored recordings can be managed directly through the App or your device's file system.

## Transfer of Rights

The App is currently published by Rustam Salavatov as an individual developer. In the future, the rights and obligations under this policy may be transferred to a legal entity. Any such transfer will be reflected in an updated version of this Privacy Policy.

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Changes will be communicated by updating the "Last updated" date above.
