# About

## Hi, I'm Rustam

I'm a solo founder and AI engineer building products that solve real problems — fast.

I've spent over a decade creating tech products: from [Life2Film](https://life2film.com) (photo-to-video AI, 1M+ users) to enterprise ML systems. Now I'm fully focused on SuperDuperAI — a product studio where every product is built with AI agents, designed for people who value simplicity, privacy, and speed.

A few years ago, building a product meant months of development, a team, and serious funding. Today, one person with AI agents can build, test, and launch in days. I want to use this moment to create products that actually matter — tools that help people, respect their privacy, and don't try to extract every last dollar through subscriptions and engagement tricks.

## What I'm Building

SuperDuperAI is a product studio, not a single product.

<ProductCards />

Each one started as a simple hypothesis, was validated fast, and follows the same principles: AI-first, privacy-respecting, minimal, useful.

I share everything I learn — the tools, the process, the failures. The era of solo builders with AI agents is just beginning.

## Let's Build Together

I'm looking for like-minded people — whether you have a product idea, want to collaborate, or just want to talk about building with AI.

## Solo Founder Manifesto

<div className="bg-card/50 border border-border/50 rounded-xl p-6 md:p-10 my-8 font-mono text-sm leading-relaxed space-y-6">

**Not where everyone is — where I'm the only one.**

I choose fields where I can become #1 in a micro-niche. Not copies, not "me too" — small, unique things that go from zero to one. I build processes that get stronger from feedback, not more fragile. Every setback is data. Every failure becomes a feature or a lesson.

---

**Principles.** AI is not a feature — it's the foundation. Every product starts with what AI agents can do better than humans. Your data stays on your device — no accounts when possible, no tracking, no data harvesting. If it works offline, it should work offline. Not everything needs a monthly fee — free if it doesn't cost me, fair pricing if it does. No dark patterns, no lock-in. One pain → one feature → launch. MVP in days, not months. If nobody wants it — kill it and move on. WIP = 1.

---

**Strategy.** Micro-niche → local monopoly → scale through partners. I go where the crowd will be in a year, not where it is today. I avoid mimetic traps where everyone copies each other. Instead, I look for quiet spaces with real demand and weak competition. 80% of effort goes to a stable core — repeatable schemas, validated processes. 20% goes to bold bets with asymmetric upside: small risk, big potential.

---

**S.E.E.D. — how I choose what to build.** Every niche must pass this filter. **S** — Searchability: forums and Reddit in top 10, few giants, little fresh video content. **E** — Evidence: real questions and pain points from real people, with sources. **E** — Ease: MVP can be built in 1–2 days on my stack. **D** — Demand: clear monetization path, long-tail search signals. If a niche is fragile — if one big player entering tomorrow would destroy the position — I don't build there. I stress-test before I commit.

---

**The method.** 1 pain → 1 feature → fast launch. Day 0: validate demand — a landing page, $20 in traffic, less than 10 clicks on CTA means kill it and move on. Day 1–2: build the smallest possible solution, one function solving one pain, no platforms, no "future-proofing". Week 1: zero signups → kill; 1–4 signups → iterate; 5+ signups → double down. Every claim needs evidence. Every metric ties back to real outcomes. Numbers without sources don't count. I'd rather launch 10 small products and find 2 that work than spend a year building one that nobody needs.

---

**Red flags I cut immediately.** "Just another feature like everyone else." One client making up more than 30% of revenue. Vanity metrics with no connection to money or retention. Anything that turns "one function" into "a platform." Releases that can't be rolled back in a day.

---

**Antifragile architecture.** Modular — any block replaceable in days. No single point of failure — one client, one channel, one vendor is never acceptable. Optionality — 3–5 small bets with asymmetric upside. Reversibility — controversial decisions only through reversible experiments.

---

**Money without overheating.** Costs near zero? Free + email capture. Real costs? One-time or usage-based first, micro-subscription later. One Stripe price, one webhook. Upsell only after the first 20–50 paying users. Revenue before automation. Cash flow before hype.

---

**The oath.**

I choose the silence of future trends, not the noise of today's crowd. I build systems that grow stronger from impact. I earn before I automate. I cut everything except value. I measure reality, not expectations. I keep the right to change my mind — fast.
