# About

## Hi, I'm Rustam

I'm a solo founder and AI engineer building products that solve real problems — fast.

I've spent over a decade creating tech products: from [Life2Film](https://life2film.com) (photo-to-video AI, 1M+ users) to enterprise ML systems. Now I'm fully focused on SuperDuperAI — a product studio where every product is built with AI agents, designed for people who value simplicity, privacy, and speed.

A few years ago, building a product meant months of development, a team, and serious funding. Today, one person with AI agents can build, test, and launch in days. I want to use this moment to create products that actually matter — tools that help people, respect their privacy, and don't try to extract every last dollar through subscriptions and engagement tricks.

## What I'm Building

SuperDuperAI is a product studio, not a single product.

<ProductCards />

Each one started as a simple hypothesis, was validated fast, and follows the same principles: AI-first, privacy-respecting, minimal, useful.

I share everything I learn — the tools, the process, the failures. The era of solo builders with AI agents is just beginning.

## Let's Build Together

I'm looking for like-minded people — whether you have a product idea, want to collaborate, or just want to talk about building with AI.

## Solo Founder Manifesto

<div className="bg-card/50 border border-border/50 rounded-xl p-6 md:p-10 my-8 font-mono text-sm leading-relaxed space-y-6">

**The Origin.**

In 2014, I started Life2Film with a dream: help people turn the moments of their lives into something meaningful. A film of your life. Not just storage — storytelling. Reflection. Memory that matters.

The technology wasn't ready. People weren't ready. I wasn't ready. In 2021, I closed it. But the dream never closed.

For ten years I accumulated knowledge, failures, and experience. I learned mobile development. I learned AI. I learned what it takes to ship. And now — the technology has finally caught up with the vision.

SuperDuperAI is not a pivot. It's the same dream with new tools. Every product I build is a step toward that original mission: help people reflect on their lives and create something that lasts. The journey matters more than the destination. I'm still on it.

---

**Why I build.**

Building is how I think. Every product is an experiment — a question asked to the world. Some questions get answers. Most don't. But the asking is the point.

Revenue is feedback, not the goal. When people pay, it means I solved something real. When they don't, I learn and move on. Money is a signal that I'm on the right track — not the track itself.

I want to create things that didn't exist before — and change something for the better.

---

**Creators, not robots.** Humans should be creators, not operators. AI should free people from friction so they can focus on what matters — their ideas, their craft, their time with family. I build tools that amplify human creativity, not replace it.

**Data belongs to people.** Data is power. When corporations and governments collect it without consent, they accumulate power over people. Privacy isn't a feature — it's a political position. Your data should stay yours. You should control who sees it, who uses it, and when. If I can build something that works on your device without ever touching a server, I will. Not because it's trendy — because it's right.

**Information wants to be free.** I share my process, my failures, my learnings — not as marketing, but as principle. If I figure something out, it should help others figure it out too.

**Technology and humanity should complement each other.** I'm drawn to ideas where technology, ecology, and human flourishing work together — not against each other. The world is one. I don't divide it by borders. I've lived as a nomad with my family, and I've seen that what we share is greater than what separates us. I was an environmental activist in Bashkortostan, fighting for clean air. That experience shaped how I see systems — who has power, who doesn't, and how technology can either concentrate or distribute it.

**Against exploitation.** I won't build products that exploit, discriminate, or extract unfairly. No dark patterns. No addiction loops. No surveillance disguised as convenience. If a business model requires making users worse off, I'm not interested.

**The world we leave behind.** I think about what we leave for the next generation. My kids are learning through self-directed education. I believe education matters deeply for society — I trained as a computer science teacher, and I haven't forgotten that. Technology should make life better, not just faster.

---

**How I build.**

One pain → one function → launch. Every product starts with one specific problem and one simple solution. Not platforms. Not "ecosystems." Not features that might be useful someday. One thing that helps one person today. MVP in days, not months. If nobody wants it — kill it and move on. The goal is learning velocity, not perfection.

Free if it costs me nothing, fair if it costs me something. I hate subscription fatigue. So do users. If a product has zero marginal cost, it should be free. If it has real costs, the pricing should be honest — one-time purchases, usage-based fees, or subscriptions that reflect actual value. No lock-in. No dark patterns. No guilt trips for canceling.

Validate before you build. Day 0: a landing page and $20 in traffic. If fewer than 10 people click — the idea dies. No mourning. Move on. Week 1: zero signups means kill; a few signups means iterate; real traction means double down. Every claim needs evidence. Numbers without sources don't count. I measure reality, not expectations.

Antifragile by design. I build systems that get stronger from stress: modular — any component replaceable in days; no single point of failure — one client, one channel, one vendor is never acceptable; optionality — small bets with asymmetric upside; reversibility — controversial decisions only through reversible experiments.

---

**Products from life.**

My products grow from my life. FaceAlarm came from my wife's face massage coaching business. Jaw Harp Synth preserves the kubyz — a traditional instrument I love. Life2Film came from wanting to remember and reflect. I build for my family first. If it solves our problem, it might solve yours.

---

**The oath.**

I choose the silence of future trends, not the noise of today's crowd. I build systems that grow stronger from impact. I create before I optimize. I earn before I automate. I cut everything except value. I measure reality, not expectations. I keep the right to change my mind — fast.

What stays when everything changes is how we treat each other. I build products. But I optimize for relationships.

---

**What I'll leave behind.**

I don't know exactly what legacy looks like. Maybe it's products that people use long after I'm gone. Maybe it's ideas that spread. Maybe it's just the example I set for my kids — that you can create something from nothing, that you can choose meaning over money, that you can build without exploiting.

Memory. Experience. A few things that changed something for someone. That would be enough.
