# About

## Hi, I'm Rustam

I'm a solo founder and AI engineer building products that solve real problems — fast.

I've spent over a decade creating tech products: from [Life2Film](https://life2film.com) (photo-to-video AI, 1M+ users) to enterprise ML systems. Now I'm fully focused on SuperDuperAI — a product studio where every product is built with AI agents, designed for people who value simplicity, privacy, and speed.

A few years ago, building a product meant months of development, a team, and serious funding. Today, one person with AI agents can build, test, and launch in days. I want to use this moment to create products that actually matter — tools that help people, respect their privacy, and don't try to extract every last dollar through subscriptions and engagement tricks.

## What I'm Building

SuperDuperAI is a product studio, not a single product.

<ProductCards />

Each one started as a simple hypothesis, was validated fast, and follows the same principles: AI-first, privacy-respecting, minimal, useful.

I share everything I learn — the tools, the process, the failures. The era of solo builders with AI agents is just beginning.

## Let's Build Together

I'm looking for like-minded people — whether you have a product idea, want to collaborate, or just want to talk about building with AI.

## Solo Founder Manifesto

<div className="bg-card/50 border border-border/50 rounded-xl p-6 md:p-10 my-8 font-mono text-sm leading-relaxed space-y-6">

**The Origin.**

I started Life2Film in 2014 with a dream: help people turn their everyday moments into meaningful stories. Not just videos — a way to reflect on life, to see the narrative in the chaos of daily existence.

The technology wasn't ready. People weren't ready. I wasn't ready. I closed it in 2021. But the dream never left.

Now, a decade later, AI has matured. I've accumulated failures, lessons, and skills. SuperDuperAI isn't a new beginning — it's the second chapter of the same story. Every product I build is a step toward that original vision: tools that help people reflect, create, and own their narrative.

---

**Why I build.**

Building products is how I think. Each one is an experiment — a question asked to the world. Revenue isn't the goal. It's feedback that I'm on the right track.

Creativity is freedom. The freedom to express, to explore, to make something that didn't exist before. AI and agents don't replace human creativity — they remove the friction so we can focus on what matters: ideas, craft, time with people we love.

We should be creators, not robots. Not operators of systems. Not data sources for corporations. Creators.

---

**What I believe.**

*Technology, ecology, and humanity should complement each other.* We live in one world. I don't divide it by borders. I've been a nomad with my family, moving between countries, and this taught me: the planet is shared, the problems are shared, the future is shared. I was an environmental activist in Bashkortostan. I've seen how technology can harm — and how it can heal. The tools we build should make life better without making the world worse.

*Data is power. It should belong to people.* When your data lives on someone else's servers, you're not the customer — you're the product. Governments and corporations accumulate data not to serve you, but to predict and control you. Privacy isn't a feature. It's architecture. On-device processing. Local storage. No accounts when possible. If I can't see your data, I can't leak it, sell it, or be forced to hand it over. When cloud makes sense — you choose to share. You control what, with whom, and for how long.

*Against exploitation.* I won't build products that extract value from vulnerable people, use dark patterns to manipulate behavior, create addiction for engagement metrics, or discriminate and exclude. Software should serve people, not extract from them.

*Subscription fatigue is real.* The subscription economy optimized for retention, not value. Not everything needs a monthly fee. If it doesn't cost me to run, it should be free. If it costs — one-time purchase or honest, transparent pricing. I build the opposite of lock-in: tools you own, data you control, payments that reflect real cost.

**Roots.**

Teacher by education. I studied to teach computer science. I believe education shapes society more than most things. My kids are self-directed learners right now — partly practical (nomad life), partly philosophical (systems need rethinking).

Activist by experience. Environmental work in my past taught me that change is possible but hard, that systems resist, and that small actions compound.

Nomad by choice. Living across borders showed me that human problems are universal and that good tools transcend language and culture.

Father, husband, builder. Many of my products start at home. FaceAlarm came from my wife's face massage coaching business. QuestSchool from homeschooling our kids. Jaw Harp Synth preserves the kubyz — a traditional instrument I love. I build what I live.

---

**Where I'm going.**

I don't know exactly. That's the point. The path matters more than the destination. Each product is an experiment. Some will fail. Some will surprise me. The skill I'm building is the ability to go from zero to one — to take an idea and make it real, fast, and learn from what happens.

Through this, I hope to: create products that change something — tools nobody built before, solving problems nobody addressed; leave something behind — memory, legacy, example for my children; stay free — to choose what I work on, who I work with, how I spend my time.

If in 10 years someone describes my contribution, I want them to say: "He made things that didn't exist before, and they made a difference."

---

**Principles.**

AI is the foundation, not a feature. Every product starts with what AI can do better than manual work. This isn't about hype — it's about leverage.

Offline-first when possible. Independence from connectivity. Independence from servers. Your tool should work on a plane, in a village, during an outage.

One pain → one feature → launch. Not platforms. Not roadmaps. One problem, one solution, shipped in days. If nobody wants it — kill it and move on.

Speed over perfection. Ship, learn, iterate. The market teaches faster than planning.

Antifragile architecture. Modular — any piece replaceable. No single point of failure. Small bets with asymmetric upside: limited downside, unlimited potential.

Money without overheating. Revenue before automation. Cash flow before hype. One Stripe price, one webhook. Scale what works, not what might work.

---

**Red flags I cut immediately.** "Just another feature like everyone else has." One client making up more than 30% of revenue. Vanity metrics with no connection to money or retention. Anything that turns "one function" into "a platform." Releases that can't be rolled back in a day. Products that exploit, discriminate, or manipulate.

---

**The oath.**

I choose the silence of future trends, not the noise of today's crowd. I build systems that grow stronger from impact. I earn before I automate. I cut everything except value. I measure reality, not expectations. I keep the right to change my mind — fast.

Information wants to be free. I share my process, my failures, my learnings — not as marketing, but as principle.

We should be creators, not robots. Technology should free humans to create, to reflect, to live — not turn them into data sources or engagement metrics.

The world is one. Borders are lines on maps. Problems are shared. Solutions should be too.

`evidence-first · ship > perfect · wip = 1 · creators, not robots`
