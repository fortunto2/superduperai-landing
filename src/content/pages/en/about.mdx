# About

## Hi, I'm Rustam

I'm a solo founder and AI engineer building products that solve real problems — fast.

I've spent over a decade creating tech products: from [Life2Film](https://life2film.com) (photo-to-video AI, 1M+ users) to enterprise ML systems. Now I'm fully focused on SuperDuperAI — a product studio where every product is built with AI agents, designed for people who value simplicity, privacy, and speed.

A few years ago, building a product meant months of development, a team, and serious funding. Today, one person with AI agents can build, test, and launch in days. I want to use this moment to create products that actually matter — tools that help people, respect their privacy, and don't try to extract every last dollar through subscriptions and engagement tricks.

## What I'm Building

SuperDuperAI is a product studio, not a single product.

<ProductCards />

Each one started as a simple hypothesis, was validated fast, and follows the same principles: AI-first, privacy-respecting, minimal, useful.

I share everything I learn — the tools, the process, the failures. The era of solo builders with AI agents is just beginning.

## Let's Build Together

I'm looking for like-minded people — whether you have a product idea, want to collaborate, or just want to talk about building with AI.

# Solo Founder Manifesto

## The Credo

**Not where everyone is — where I'm the only one.** I choose fields where I can become #1 in a micro-niche. Not copies, not "me too" — small, unique things that go from zero to one.

I build processes that get stronger from feedback, not more fragile. Every setback is data. Every failure becomes a feature or a lesson. Antifragility is not a buzzword — it's how I design systems and make decisions.

## Principles

</FeatureGrid>

## The Strategy

**Micro-niche → local monopoly → scale through partners.**

I go where the crowd will be in a year, not where it is today. I avoid mimetic traps where everyone copies each other. Instead, I look for quiet spaces with real demand and weak competition.

80% of effort goes to a stable core — repeatable schemas, validated processes. 20% goes to bold bets with asymmetric upside: small risk, big potential.

## Choosing What to Build: S.E.E.D.

Every niche must pass this filter:

- **S — Searchability**: forums and Reddit in top 10, few giants, little fresh video content
- **E — Evidence**: real questions and pain points from real people, with sources
- **E — Ease**: MVP can be built in 1–2 days on my stack
- **D — Demand**: clear monetization path, long-tail search signals

If a niche is fragile — if one big player entering tomorrow would destroy the position — I don't build there. I stress-test before I commit.

## The Method

**1 pain → 1 feature → fast launch.**

- **Day 0**: Validate demand. A landing page, $20 in traffic. Less than 10 clicks on CTA? Kill it. Move on.
- **Day 1–2**: Build the smallest possible solution. One function solving one pain. No platforms, no "future-proofing".
- **Week 1**: Zero signups → kill. 1–4 signups → iterate. 5+ signups → double down.

Every claim needs evidence. Every metric ties back to real outcomes. Numbers without sources don't count. I'd rather launch 10 small products and find 2 that work than spend a year building one that nobody needs.

## Red Flags I Cut Immediately

- "Just another feature like everyone else"
- One client making up >30% of revenue
- Vanity metrics with no connection to money or retention
- Anything that turns "one function" into "a platform"
- Releases that can't be rolled back in a day

## Antifragile Architecture

- **Modular**: any block replaceable in days
- **No single point of failure**: one client, one channel, one vendor — never
- **Optionality**: 3–5 small bets with asymmetric upside
- **Reversibility**: controversial decisions only through reversible experiments

## Money Without Overheating

Costs near zero? Free + email capture. Real costs? One-time or usage-based first, micro-subscription later. One Stripe price, one webhook. Upsell only after the first 20–50 paying users.

**Revenue before automation. Cash flow before hype.**

## The Oath

> I choose the silence of future trends, not the noise of today's crowd.
> I build systems that grow stronger from impact.
> I earn before I automate.
> I cut everything except value.
> I measure reality, not expectations.
> I keep the right to change my mind — fast.

**Evidence-first. Schema-first. WIP = 1. Ship > Perfect.**
