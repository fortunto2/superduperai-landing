# About

## Hi, I'm Rustam

I'm a solo founder and AI engineer. I build products with AI agents — tools designed for people who value simplicity, privacy, and speed.

## What I'm Building

SuperDuperAI is a product studio, not a single product.

<ProductCards />

Each one started as a simple hypothesis, was validated fast, and follows the same principles: AI-first, privacy-respecting, minimal, useful. Everything I build is open source or shared on [GitHub](https://github.com/fortunto2).

## Let's Build Together

I'm looking for like-minded people — whether you have a product idea, want to collaborate, or just want to talk about building with AI.

## Unlock Manifesto

<div className="bg-card/50 border border-border/50 rounded-xl p-6 md:p-10 my-8 font-mono text-sm leading-relaxed space-y-6">

**Not where everyone is — where I'm the only one.**

I started [Life2Film](https://life2film.com) in 2014 — tools to turn everyday moments into stories. The technology wasn't ready. I closed it in 2021. The dream never left. SuperDuperAI is the second chapter of the same story.

Building products is how I think. Each one is an experiment — a question asked to the world. Creativity is freedom. AI and agents don't replace human creativity — they remove the friction so we can focus on what matters: ideas, craft, time with people we love. We should be creators, not robots.

---

**Principles.**

Technology, ecology, and humanity should complement each other. The tools we build should make life better without making the world worse.

AI is the foundation, not a feature. Every product starts with what AI can do better than manual work.

Offline-first when possible. Independence from connectivity. Independence from servers. Your tool should work on a plane, in a village, during an outage.

Data is power — it belongs to people. Privacy isn't a feature, it's architecture. On-device processing, local storage, no accounts when possible. If I can't see your data, I can't leak it, sell it, or be forced to hand it over.

Open source by default. Knowledge compounds when it's shared.

---

**What I want to unlock.**

Memory tools — ways to capture, store, and relive life.
I've been thinking about this since 2014. Technology finally caught up.

Tools I'd use myself — I build what I need first.
If it helps others — great.

A community of builders — people who ship fast,
respect users, and play long-term games.

---

**Strategy.**

One pain → one feature → launch. Not platforms. Not roadmaps. One problem, one solution, shipped in days. If nobody wants it — kill it and move on.

Speed over perfection. Ship, learn, iterate. The market teaches faster than planning.

Fair pricing. Free if it costs me nothing, honest pricing if it does. No lock-in, no dark patterns.

---

**Antifragile architecture.**

Modular — any piece replaceable. No single point of failure. Small bets with asymmetric upside: limited downside, unlimited potential.

---

**The oath.**

I choose the silence of future trends, not the noise of today's crowd. I build systems that grow stronger from impact. I earn before I automate. I cut everything except value. I measure reality, not expectations. I keep the right to change my mind — fast.

We should be creators, not robots. Technology should free humans to create, to reflect, to live — not turn them into data sources or engagement metrics.

The world is one. Borders are lines on maps. Problems are shared. Solutions should be too.
