# About

## Hi, I'm Rustam

I'm a solo founder and AI engineer. I build products with AI agents — tools designed for people who value simplicity, privacy, and speed.

## What I'm Building

SuperDuperAI is a product studio, not a single product.

<ProductCards />

Each one started as a simple hypothesis, was validated fast, and follows the same principles: AI-first, privacy-respecting, minimal, useful. Everything I build is open source or shared on [GitHub](https://github.com/fortunto2).

## Let's Build Together

I'm looking for like-minded people — whether you have a product idea, want to collaborate, or just want to talk about building with AI.

## Solo Founder Manifesto

<div className="bg-card/50 border border-border/50 rounded-xl p-6 md:p-10 my-8 font-mono text-sm leading-relaxed space-y-6">

**The Origin.**

I started [Life2Film](https://life2film.com) in 2014 with a dream: help people turn their everyday moments into meaningful stories. Not just videos — a way to reflect on life, to see the narrative in the chaos of daily existence.

The technology wasn't ready. People weren't ready. I wasn't ready. I closed it in 2021. But the dream never left.

Now, a decade later, AI has matured. I've accumulated failures, lessons, and skills. SuperDuperAI isn't a new beginning — it's the second chapter of the same story. Every product I build is a step toward that original vision: tools that help people reflect, create, and own their narrative.

---

**Why I build.**

Building products is how I think. Each one is an experiment — a question asked to the world. Revenue isn't the goal. It's feedback that I'm on the right track.

Creativity is freedom. The freedom to express, to explore, to make something that didn't exist before. AI and agents don't replace human creativity — they remove the friction so we can focus on what matters: ideas, craft, time with people we love.

We should be creators, not robots. Not operators of systems. Not data sources for corporations. Creators.

---

**What I believe.**

*Technology, ecology, and humanity should complement each other.* We live in one world. I don't divide it by borders. I've been a nomad with my family, moving between countries, and this taught me: the planet is shared, the problems are shared, the future is shared. I was an environmental activist in Bashkortostan. I've seen how technology can harm — and how it can heal. The tools we build should make life better without making the world worse.

*Data is power. It should belong to people.* When your data lives on someone else's servers, you're not the customer — you're the product. Privacy isn't a feature. It's architecture. On-device processing. Local storage. No accounts when possible. If I can't see your data, I can't leak it, sell it, or be forced to hand it over. When cloud makes sense — you choose to share. You control what, with whom, and for how long.

*Against exploitation.* I won't build products that extract value from vulnerable people, use dark patterns to manipulate behavior, create addiction for engagement metrics, or discriminate and exclude. Software should serve people, not extract from them.

*Open source by default.* I share code, tools, and learnings on [GitHub](https://github.com/fortunto2) — not as marketing, but as principle. If I figure something out, it should help others figure it out too. Knowledge compounds when it's shared.

---

**Roots.**

Teacher by education. I studied to teach computer science. I believe education shapes society more than most things.

Activist by experience. Environmental work taught me that change is possible but hard, that systems resist, and that small actions compound.

Nomad by choice. Living across borders showed me that human problems are universal and that good tools transcend language and culture.

Father, husband, builder. Many of my products start at home. FaceAlarm came from my wife's face massage coaching business. Jaw Harp Synth preserves the kubyz — a traditional instrument I love. I build what I live.

---

**Principles.**

AI is the foundation, not a feature. Every product starts with what AI can do better than manual work. This isn't about hype — it's about leverage.

Offline-first when possible. Independence from connectivity. Independence from servers. Your tool should work on a plane, in a village, during an outage.

One pain → one feature → launch. Not platforms. Not roadmaps. One problem, one solution, shipped in days. If nobody wants it — kill it and move on.

Speed over perfection. Ship, learn, iterate. The market teaches faster than planning.

Antifragile architecture. Modular — any piece replaceable. No single point of failure. Small bets with asymmetric upside: limited downside, unlimited potential.

Fair pricing. Not everything needs a subscription. Free if it costs me nothing, honest pricing if it does. No lock-in, no dark patterns, no guilt trips for canceling. Revenue before automation. Cash flow before hype.

---

**The oath.**

I choose the silence of future trends, not the noise of today's crowd. I build systems that grow stronger from impact. I earn before I automate. I cut everything except value. I measure reality, not expectations. I keep the right to change my mind — fast.

We should be creators, not robots. Technology should free humans to create, to reflect, to live — not turn them into data sources or engagement metrics.

The world is one. Borders are lines on maps. Problems are shared. Solutions should be too.

`evidence-first · ship > perfect · wip = 1 · creators, not robots`
